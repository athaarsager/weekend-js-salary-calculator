## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

This project is a salary calculator that can be used to track who has been hired at a company and the monthly cost to keep those employees.
The page displays a form where users can enter an employee's first and last name, companyID, position title, and annual salary.
Once this information is submitted, it is added to a table and the company's monthly costs are updated accordingly.
Users also have the option of deleting added employees. As of this version, this will not update the total monthly cost. Stay tuned!
